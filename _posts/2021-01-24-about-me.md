Hi everyone! My name is **Simon Good** and I am a Junior at Christopher Newport University. Currently, I am in the process of earning my bachelor’s degree in **history** with a double minor in **communications** and **writing**.

Writing has always been something that has interested me. Yet at the same time, I am _still_ very new to it. For much of my life, it was something that I always felt competent at, but it was never something that I saw the complete value of. It was not until very recently that I not only saw writings true worth, but simultaneously began to fall in love with it.

Arguably the biggest reason why I took this class lies in my desire to _become_ a better writer. Although I feel used to writing traditional scholarly papers and stories, bringing them to an online platform is something that not only intrigues me but is something that I find extremely essential. Especially considering that the world is moving more and more online every day, I find the value of being able to write and present information on an online medium invaluable to success in the modern era.

After I graduate CNU, I am honestly not exactly sure what I want to do. However, I do know it follows writing in some way. Last semester, I started a blog to create a platform for something that I am extremely passionate about. Through writing, I wanted to help people find their purpose. I did not expect to love it as much as I did. The interaction and community that writing online provides is incredible not only socially but also practically.  Although I am not sure what exactly the future holds, I want to use writing, especially online, to do something along these lines.

Besides writing, there are a few other fun things that I believe define me. I am a huge sports fan, I love movies, I love to travel (particularly to ![Italy](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goway.com%2Ftrips%2Fdest%2Feurope%2Fcntry%2Fitaly%2Freg%2Famalfi-coast%2F&psig=AOvVaw1kexFLBCxIFv6EIN6S0Q5N&ust=1612017366593000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCMDYnOmuwe4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAR)), and I enjoy being around close friends and family. These things are hugely important to me and help to provide me clarity and joy when I need it.
