For our third project in Digital Humanities, we focused on coding Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s _The Yellow Wall-paper_. To accomplish this, we used TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), which is a form of Extensible Markup Language, to highlight the many discrepancies and nuances of Gilman’s original manuscript. As a result of this work, the viewer of the finished product will be able to see how the original manuscript perhaps conveys “hidden” or indirect details that were later changed in future editions of the story.

To begin the project, each member of the class received a Google Doc containing different pages of the original manuscript. Before the coding began, it was important to review these pages to define and highlight any interesting marks that Gilman wrote in her original draft. This section was quite easy yet equally helpful. When it came time to insert the code into the writing, the work that was done on the Google Doc allowed me to easily reference and duplicate the obscurities that I previously highlighted. It also gave me space to freely mark up the text so I would not risk messing up my code. Using this format streamlined the entire project and made it much more accessible.

When it came time to code, I would be lying if I said that I was not nervous. For most of my life, I have been decent with technology. I know how to fix certain issues and I am experienced when it comes to navigating different software such as Windows or Apple iOS. However, I have never touched the world of coding. In our first class messing around with Oxygen (the coding software), I became slightly overwhelmed when I saw the long and seemingly complicated strands of code in the editor. For someone who has never used XML in this format, the immediate presentation was certainly daunting.

However, as soon as I started working on the project, I began to realize how deceptively simple the process was. Although everything looked massively complicated at first glance, I quickly discovered that everything had a purpose. Every code mark for paragraph breaks, extra spaces, or strikethroughs was clearly defined and made perfect sense. The further along I got in my work, the more I noticed that the “randomness” of the code that I perceived at the beginning was actually very organized text.

This realization, in turn, not only made the process of coding easier but forced me to pay close attention to the original text itself. As every code had a purpose, it made me question why the author made these “mistakes” or changes. Certain alterations, such as switching the word “have” for “occupy”, for example, made me wonder _why_ the author thought this change to be worthwhile. Working with TEI put me somewhat in the headspace of the author, which was something that I never envisioned occurring. This gave me a deeper appreciation and understanding of the text overall.

In conclusion, the use of TEI proved to be a daunting yet rewarding experience. Not only did I gain knowledge and comfort in coding, but I gained a much deeper understanding of the relationship between coding and writing altogether.
