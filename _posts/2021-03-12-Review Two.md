The interactive project “Digital Augustan Rome'' is an extensive and highly detailed recreation of the ancient city during the year 14 A.D. Using a multitude of written as well as physical evidence, this site uses mapping technology to visually demonstrate the complex stories and history behind urban Rome during the height of Augustan’s reign. The overall aim of this project is to use the reconstructed Roman cityscape to help foster a greater understanding of the period that is otherwise lacking.

When judging this project on the basis of Digital Humanities, it passes with flying colors. The scholarship that is found here is impressive. In order to compose the interactive map, the scholars behind the site’s creation had to find extremely specific source material relating to a very narrow topic. Furthermore, they then had to carefully consider where and how these sources fit within one another in the context of a very small time frame. From a historical perspective, gathering and configuring evidence is not an easy task. It is easy to view how the material fits together from the perspective of hindsight but detailing the information to create that hindsight is immensely difficult.

Just as impressive as the scholarship is the technology that is behind the project. In order to create the map, the authors employed sophisticated mapping software such as [Autocad](https://www.chartercollege.edu/news-hub/who-uses-autocad-and-why-it-important) with a CAD overlay, Surfer (which is used to accurately display natural elevations), and [Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator](https://www.cia.edu/blog/2017/08/the-difference-between-adobe-photoshop-and-adobe-illustrator#:~:text=Photoshop%20is%20based%20on%20pixels,photos%20or%20raster%2Dbased%20art.), which were both used to make the finished product more aesthetically pleasing. The finished map presented on the site is detailed yet clean, and I find that it works very well.

However, there are certain aspects within this project that I believe need improvement. The first issue comes from the home screen. When the webpage loads, the viewer is immediately met with an almost overwhelming amount of clickable tabs. Although these tabs are the source of the historical information, they are grouped very tightly together in extremely large numbers. When I loaded the page for the first time, I was not only surprised by the sheer number of tabs but also confused as to their purpose. The website does not voluntarily give you background information, but instead makes you search it out yourself. Although pop-up screens can be annoying in certain circumstances, I believe that it is much needed here. A brief “about” paragraph that immediately appears as soon as the site loads would help cut the immediate overwhelming feeling as well as provide a sense of what the viewer was looking at.

The next issue I found is more of a technical one. When navigating to the “Directory” tab, the viewer can find a search bar that contains all of the entry points that are visible on the map. Next to the search bar, there are three main options. The “Records with Locations” tab, the “Records Without Locations” tab, and the “Sub Voce” tab. The site does not provide any clarification on what “Sub Voce” means. While the majority of the search bar functions well, there are multiple issues within “Records Without Locations”. Primarily, a few of the articles within the search criteria do not load or appear on the screen. Although it is difficult to decide whether these simply do not load or were purposefully left out, their absence does influence the usability of the project. If someone were looking for exact information within the search section, they could be easily misled by missing articles. If the information or source material is not present, the authors of the site should simply remove the headers with the missing articles. This would overall clean up the search section and greatly add to the overall user experience.

However, despite some of these issues, “Digital Augustan Rome” is an excellent project. By using the advantages of technology to accurately recreate the Roman cityscape, they reveal a very interesting piece of history that many would never see.
