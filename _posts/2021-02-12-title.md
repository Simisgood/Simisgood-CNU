The digital project Jheronimus Bosch, the Garden of Earthly Delights is an interactive platform that uses the creativity of digital media to tell the intriguing story of Jheronimus Bosch’s famous piece of art. As the creators of the site outline in the “About” section, the goal of this project is three-fold. Firstly, one will better be able to understand the creative thoughts and intentions of the painter himself. Secondly, through the use of interactive storytelling, one will be able to see and hear the many cultural notes of the Middle Ages. Lastly, the viewer of this project will ponder the question and overall relationship of sins and morals that was originally proposed by Jheronimus himself. All of this is accomplished and presented in an interactive way that uses substantial audio and visual elements.

As this is a Digital Humanities project, I think it is important to begin by quickly discussing the use of technology within the site. Given that the basis of this project is a still piece of artwork, the implementation of technology adds a profound aspect of life to the image. The creators of the site did an excellent job integrating narrative audio excerpts, interactive story overlays, and a beautifully rendered image of the Garden of Earthly Delights. The image is so detailed that the viewer can see the cracks in the paint and the careful wear that the art piece has taken over time. This image includes the front and back of the tri-fold piece. Arguably even more impressive is the audio distinction that is available in the project. If the viewer zooms in on any scene of the painting, background noise will play to simulate what it would sound like if one was actually there. The different layers of audio contribute heavily to the desired atmosphere of the project.

However, there are some things that I would like the creators of the site to fix/address. The first issue that I noted was the overall speed of the site. Some of the buttons, such as the “Tour” and “Panels” links, lag severely. I found myself clicking the buttons three or four times before the animation or redirect occurred on screen. This severely impacts the overall useability of the project. Secondly, in the “freely explore” mode, some of the story links that appear on the artwork itself are located too high on the screen behind the taskbar. If you try to click on these links, the different tabs on top of the page obstruct you from doing so. The only way around this is to essentially pinch and zoom, but this too can glitch, occasionally blocking the viewer from scrolling around the piece. However, in fairness, this was tested using a mousepad, not an independent mouse. The result here could vary. The last issue I noted occurred in the “fullscreen” mode. For some reason, the viewer cannot zoom in on the closed panel if the site is in fullscreen. This is possible if the image is zoomed out, but not the former. These issues could be addressed through simple rearranging and bug fixes.

However, despite these issues, the project that is presented is still very impressive. The sounds, stories, and visual elements pop to deliver the research and art in a much different fashion.  Through the use of technology, the creators were able to bring to life a still image and immerse the viewer in the story being told.
